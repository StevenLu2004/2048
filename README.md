# 2048

A simple C++ implementation of the classic game of 2048.

## Why

Because my friends are trying to recreate the game individually.

## Install

Clone this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/StevenLu2004/2048
```

And build:

```shell
# If you wish to install to your $PATH
make install

# Else
make
```

Cleaning up:

```shell
# Remove object files
make clean

# Remove executable as well
make cleanall
```

## Run

```shell
# Run from folder
./2048

# Run from $PATH
2048
```
